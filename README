Extended Audioop
By Jon Arne Jørgensen <jonjon.arnearne@gmail.com>

This is an extension to the python audioop module to make it handle 24Bit PCM data.
This module is a drop-in replacement for the original audioop package.

I've ported all functions except adpcm2lin since I don't have any adpcm files to test with.

I have not done any changes to findfit, findmax and findfactor.
I think these 3 functions should work unmodified, but I've not tested them.
